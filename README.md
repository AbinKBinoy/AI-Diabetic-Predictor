🩺 AI Diabetic Predictor
An AI-powered machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a patient based on key health indicators.

📌 Overview
This project uses a machine learning model trained on medical data to classify whether a patient is likely to have diabetes or not. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can assist in early detection and prevention strategies.

⚙️ Features
✅ Accepts input features such as glucose level, BMI, insulin, blood pressure, etc.
✅ Predicts whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
✅ Built with Python and common ML libraries (Scikit-lear / Pandas / NumPy / Matplotlib).
✅ Lightweight and beginner-friendly project to showcase ML in healthcare.

🧑‍💻 Tech Stack
Language: Python 3
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)

Dataset: PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset (CSV file provided)
